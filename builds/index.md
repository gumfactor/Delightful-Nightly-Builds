## Full Catalog

| Date | Category | Complexity | Title | Short Description | Tech | Status | Your Rating | Rating Notes |
|------|----------|------------|-------|-------------------|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 2026-06-06 | B | ambitious | AI Session Context Bridge (ctxlog) | Python CLI to capture AI coding session state and generate markdown handoff documents | Python 3, stdlib, pytest | complete | 3 | Requires manual entry to be useful — value depends entirely on what you write into it, making it no better than a markdown file. Architecture is sound but the wrong layer was automated. Would score higher with auto-capture of git state and Claude Code session transcript. |
