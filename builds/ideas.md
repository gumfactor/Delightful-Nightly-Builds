# Build Idea Backlog

> **Claude:** Append the ideas you considered but didn't build after every fresh-idea session.
> Mark a drawn idea's Status as `built` when it gets selected for a build.
> **You:** Add a rating (1–10) and Rating Notes to any idea to influence its lottery weight and guide future builds.
> Leave the rating blank (—) to keep the default weight (5 tickets).
> Set Status to `skipped` on any idea you never want built.
> Add an Idea Brief when an idea needs richer requirements than fit in one table row.
> Linked briefs live in `builds/idea-briefs/` and must be read before the build PRD is written.

## How the Lottery Works

Claude selects tonight's **category** and **complexity target** first (from the rotation),
then filters this backlog to matching ideas before running the draw. Ideas that don't
match tonight's category or are too complex for tonight's target are skipped — if the
filtered pool is empty, Claude generates fresh ideas instead.

When a draw does happen, each matching idea's probability is proportional to its ticket count:

| Your Rating | Tickets in Draw |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1 — much less likely |
| 2–3 | 2–3 |
| — (blank) or 5 | 5 — default |
| 7–8 | 7–8 |
| 10 | 10 — most likely |

Tickets = Your Rating directly. Blank = 5 tickets.

If no pending ideas exist in the backlog, the lottery is skipped and Claude
always generates fresh ideas.
